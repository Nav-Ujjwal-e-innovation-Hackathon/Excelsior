1.Takeoff to target altitude:
while True do
    channel[x].override = channel[x] + x   //x is the throttle channel
    if Altitude >= target*0.95 
        return
    time.sleep(x)

2. Altitude stability
while True do
    if Altitude >= (target)*1.1 then 
        channel[x].override = channel[x] - x
    if Altitude <= (target)*0.9 then
        channel[x].override = channel[x] + x
    time.sleep(x)

3. Landing 
while Altitude >= x cm do   //x is the lading platform altitude
    channel[x].override = channel[x] - y
    time.sleep(x)

4. Moving the Pitch, Roll and Yaw
channel[Channel].override = channel[Channel] + (Direction * x)
for i to Duration(Time) do 
    time.sleep(x)
end for
channel[Channel].override = channel[Channel] - (Direction * x)
